It's no secret that there's big money to be made in violating your privacy. Companies will pay big bucks to learn more about you, and service providers on the web are eager to get their hands on as much information about you as possible.

Your personal information is valuable. More valuable than you might think.

With DoNotTrack installed on your iOS device, never worry about somebody tracking you while you browse web on Safari.

This app needs to be set up from the Safari Settings. Just have to enable the DoNotTrack content blocker.

Due to Apple's limitations, DoNotTrack will only work on devices with 64-bit processors. This includes iPhone 5s and up, all iPad Airs, and iPad mini 2 and up.

DoNotTrack has no access at all as to what web pages you visit.
